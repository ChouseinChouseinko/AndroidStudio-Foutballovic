# AndroidStudio-Foutballovic
In this application i tested my self in Java Basics and Android Studio.
This is my first try as a Android studio developer. 
What i did ?
First of all, i made a textView which i put it in the top of the view and i texted: "Welcome to our Application".
Then i dropped also an editText in the view , where user can text whatever he wants.This does't make sense but i dropped it to see how it is working.
Later, i put a Button with a name "Subscribe to Premium" which when i click to the button then it shows a message "Premium Unlocked".This message created with a Toast message.
Finally, i upload my own logo for the application and put it in the view.
